A small program designed to find a counterexample to the PSW conjecture, given below.

# PSW Conjecture
Let p be an odd number, with p ≡ ± 2 (mod 5). If
- $$2^{p-1} \equiv 1 $$ (mod p), and
- $$f_{p+1} \equiv 0 $$ (mod p)

Then p is a prime number.

John Selfridge, Carl Pomerance, and Samuel Wagstaff developed this conjecture. No counterexample or proof is known yet.
